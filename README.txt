PABikeLaws
==========

A printable version of selected Pennsylvania motor vehicle laws, relevant to pedalcycles.

The PDF is the recommended download format; use the Word format only if you need/want to make changes (and feel free to send a pull request for posting an updated version, if your changes are more generally useful). 

This is intended to be printed double-sided on three sheets of paper, so that it can be more easily carried by cyclists.

The first page highlights rules about riding on the right side of the roadway, which may be used e.g. in discussions with police officers attempting to ticket cyclists for taking the right lane.

The back of the first page highlights rules about passing, including the "4' rule" and that subject to the legal disclaimer below, drivers can cross double yellow lines to pass a cyclist with the required 4' of space as long as it is safe to do so.  This page also shows the pedalcycle exception to minimum speed regulations. 

The second page has rules around stop signs, yield signs, and turn signals.  These rules of the road apply to all vehicles, including bicycles, and are provided as a reminder to cyclists.  This page also has the rule that drivers can't turn right cutting off a pedalcycle-as-special-vehicle/pedestrian going straight.

The third page has rules about parking, including some exceptions specific to pedalcycles.
